Commander1 Module was developed in order to automate some of the more time consuming
tasks related to editing of Commander1 parameterfiles. The module works by reading
in and parsing an existing parameterfile into json format. Data on this format is
easily processed and accessable, allowing for automation of recursive processes such
as for instance relabeling of parameters after band removals. After configuration,
the data is written to file on the format of typical parameterfiles.

Functionality currently supported by the module:
    - Continue From Run: Updates all init files to those of a previous run, and
        copies them over to data folder.
    - NSIDE: changes nside, including all occurences of the nside value in parameters.
    - Chain Directory: Changes the chain directory and creates one if it doesnt exist.
    - Toggle Output Frequencies: Toggles on/off all OUTPUT_FREQUENCY_COMPONENT_MAPS.
    - Toggle Template Fits: Toggles on/off wheter or not to sample the template for a
        band.
    - Add Band: Pick band from list of available bands and append to parameterfile.
    - Remove Band: Remove a band from included bands. Also makes sure that reference
        bands are properly updates and co-lines are deleted.
    - Add Foreground: Adds a foreground from included foregrounds to parameterfile.
    - Remove Foreground: Removes a foreground from the parameterfile and relabels all
        parameters.
